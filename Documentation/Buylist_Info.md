#Instructions for making a buy-list (sourcing parts)

Consult the latest schematic and BOM.

Additional instructions:

*all components should be through-hole
*pots like [these](http://www.banzaimusic.com/Alpha-16-PC-ANG-1k-REV-log.html)
*the rotary encoder should include a switch, like [this one](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTc0WDgwMA==/z/tXMAAOxyjP1R0Y~8/$T2eC16d,!%29cE9s4Pu,p!BR0Y+8COh!~~60_35.JPG). it must have a nut for affixing to enclosure. keep it under 3eur, if possible,
*ISP is a 2x3 pin DIL male pin header
*pots PT_OUT_VOL and PT_GAIN are log. All others are lin.
*all resistors are 1/4w or 1/2w 1% metal film
*the display is the smallest possible 7seg, 2digit, common cathode display
*the list should include knobs for pots and the encoder. slim ones, like [these](http://www.banzaimusic.com/Mini-Fluted-knob-violet.html) and [these](http://www.banzaimusic.com/Davies-Knob-1900.html)
*LEDs should be 3mm bi-colour green/red
*100n and 22n caps *must* be ceramic
*you can replace the r-2r resistors in the schematic with a *10pin, 8-bit SIL r-2r network* by, for example, Bourns. I'll draw the PCB in such a way, that both a network and single resistors fit
*the enclosure is 125B
*the list should also include regular pedal stuff (jacks, led, 3pdt). no battery snap
*the spst/spdt lever switches should be appropriately sized
*all chips should have sockets

For extra details, and to eliminate any doubt, here's a pic of the parts we want:
